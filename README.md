# Translation Manager

This react application is developed for editing json translation files. This is purely a frontend application and saves all data in the users browser.

## What it does

Translation Manager is basically a json editor. You can load a reference json and a target json. All translation keys will be based on the reference file. Then the target file will be scanned for matching keys. Each matching key will get its value from target file. Unmatching target file keys will be disregarded. This way, you get a synced version of the target file with the reference file. 

Target file is optional and you can start editing with only a reference file. All translation values will be blank.

## Help translate this app

The application interface is in English and Turkish. If you would like to contribute by translating to other languages, download the english [translation.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donis3/translation-manager/master/public/locales/en/translation.json). You can use this app to help edit this file :>
